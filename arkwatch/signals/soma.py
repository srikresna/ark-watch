"""soma.py — SOMA signals: maturity buckets, TIPS split, net liquidity, float scarcity.

Data basis (migration v7, harvested by fetchers/soma.py per PLAN-SOMA.md):
  - soma_holdings  — per-CUSIP weekly snapshots (as_of_date = Wednesday)
  - soma_summary   — weekly aggregate incl. rolling_off_7d/30d/90d
  - raw_observations FRED:WALCL (weekly Wednesday, $M) · FISCAL:TGA_DAILY
    (daily, $M) · FRED:RRPONTSYD (daily, $B)

v9 additions (PLAN-NYFED-FULL §2, degradable per-table when absent):
  - soma_agency_summary — weekly agency portfolio totals (MBS/CMBS/debts) on
    the SAME Wednesday grid → the Net Liq 'MBS/other' residual splits into an
    exact ΔMBS + a small 'other' (repo/float) residual
  - fed_operations — desk outright operations (tsy|ambs) → the ops explainer
    ties the weekly gross purchases to concrete auction results

Units: every money value RETURNED or RENDERED by this module is $B. The SOMA
tables store par in raw USD (PLAN-SOMA §3) → one conversion at the boundary
(PAR_TO_B); WALCL/TGA are $M → M_TO_B; RRPONTSYD is natively $B.

Portfolio-change semantics (verified to the dollar on 107/107 consecutive
week-pairs — 108 backfilled weeks, 2026-09-03): soma_summary.weekly_change is ΣchangeFromPriorWeek over
issues that SURVIVE the week — par maturing during the week silently leaves
the snapshot, so it never appears as a negative change. Identity:
Δtotal_par = weekly_change − prior week's rolling_off_7d. Portfolio and
liquidity math therefore uses Δtotal_par (consecutive snapshot totals);
weekly_change is exposed as gross purchases only.
