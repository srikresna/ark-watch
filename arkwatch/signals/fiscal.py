"""fiscal.py — Treasury fiscal signals (fiscaldata, migration v10).

Data basis (migration v10, harvested by the fd fiscaldata layer):
  - fd_auctions          — FULL per-CUSIP auction history 1979→ (~14k rows);
                           the calibration gift: every demand percentile below
                           is measured against ~50 years of same-term auctions
  - fd_debt_transactions — rolling ~14d Issues/Redemptions, Marketable AND
                           Nonmarketable (net issuance reads MARKETABLE only)
  - fd_interest_expense  — monthly interest expense, hierarchical rows
                           (month_amt / fytd_amt per category/group/type)
  - fd_avg_rates         — monthly avg interest rate, per-instrument rows AND
                           aggregate rows like 'Total Marketable'
  - raw_observations FISCAL:DEBT_TOTAL (daily, raw USD)

Units: SPLIT BY FAMILY (fetch-layer identity proof, migration v10 comment):
fd_debt_transactions.amount_today is $ MILLIONS (the DTS family — same as the
TGA series; ΣFYTD(issues−redemptions) matched Δdebt-to-penny to the dollar) →
M_TO_B there; fd_interest_expense and the FISCAL:DEBT_* series are raw USD →
PAR_TO_B (soma convention); the debt stock renders $T (RAW_TO_T). Bid-to-cover,
percentiles and rates are dimensionless.

Term matching is defensive on BOTH security_term and security_type: the pairs
that matter are Bill 4-Week + Note 2/5/10-Year + Bond 30-Year, and a bare term
match would pick up 10-Year TIPS / 2-Year FRN auctions whose bid-to-cover
distributions are a different animal. Normalization (case/whitespace/hyphen
insensitive, plus a compound-term prefix pass) tolerates live string variants;
unmatched shapes degrade silently.

Degradation: every public function no-ops ({}, None, 0) when its v10 table is
missing or empty — pre-v10 DBs skip the whole layer (_table_exists convention).
