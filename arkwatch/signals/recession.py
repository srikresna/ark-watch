"""recession.py — the recession triangulation: model / survey / rule.

Three INDEPENDENT recession gauges, one line:
  - CLEVE:RECPROB       — yield-curve MODEL probability (monthly)
  - PHILLY:ANXIOUS      — professional forecasters' SURVEY probability for
                          next quarter (mean probability of negative QoQ GDP)
  - FRED:SAHMREALTIME   — the Sahm RULE trigger (3m-avg unemployment vs its
                          12m low; >= 0.50 = recession onset historically)

Methodological independence is the point: a curve signal (market), a survey
signal (humans), and a labor signal (statistic) rarely fire together on
noise. All three being elevated simultaneously is the strongest single
macro warning this system can print.

Degradation: each leg renders alone; the whole line disappears when ALL are
missing. Freshness per frequency (M/Q/M windows from brief._STALE_DAYS).
