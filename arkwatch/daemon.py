"""daemon.py — in-app scheduler: one process, jobs = isolated subprocesses.

A 30-second loop checks the WIB clock and runs due jobs as subprocesses. Each
job is a fresh Python process (crashes/leaks do not spread). The heartbeat
file is refreshed every loop; if it goes stale for more than 5 minutes, the
daemon is dead or hung. A lockfile prevents a second instance (duplicate
briefs).
Run: python -m arkwatch daemon
