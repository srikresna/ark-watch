"""ecbwatch.py — ECB hike/cut/hold probabilities per Governing Council
meeting, derived from CME 3M €STR futures (ESR) settlements. D-006.

METHODOLOGY (research-verified 2026-09-10; full write-up in
docs/methodology/estrwatch.md):

- ESR settle = 100 − expected arithmetic-average €STR over the contract's
  Reference Quarter [third-Wednesday of the contract month, +3 months).
  NOTE the contract month names the START of accrual (verified empirically:
  JUN26 implied 2.1925 matches realized Jun-17→Sep-9 €STR 2.18-2.19).
  xccy._imm_approx is 2 days early for ESR (third MONDAY) and is NOT used
  here — see L11 in ISSUE.md D-006.
- ECB decisions take effect the first Wednesday AFTER the Thursday
  announcement (start of the new reserve-maintenance period; verified: €STR
  jumped on 2026-06-17, six days after the 2026-06-11 decision).
- 8 meetings/year vs 4 quarterly contracts → one contract spans 1-2
  meetings, so a JOINT solve is required: day-weighted least squares over
  all contracts simultaneously (generalizes the FedWatch day-weighting
  N/(M+N) to multiple jumps; the single-meeting case reduces exactly to
  the fedwatch running-rate algebra — proven by unit test).
- Probabilities use the official CME FedWatch characteristic/mantissa
  convention on a 25bp grid: expected moves E = δ/0.25, k = floor(|E|),
  m = frac(|E|) → P(k×25bp) = 1−m, P((k+1)×25bp) = m.
- Anchor = the latest €STR FIXING (ECB:ESTR), never DFR−spread: ±5bp anchor
  error moves probabilities ±20pp. The €STR−DFR basis is frozen per
  snapshot (the official CME €STRWatch convention); it cancels in rate
  CHANGES, so implied DFR after meeting j = dfr_now + Σ δ_i.
- Residual gate: RMS(A·δ̂ − b) ≤ 3bp else the snapshot is flagged degraded
  and the brief prints a ⚠ next to the number.
