"""xccy.py — EUR/USD cross-currency basis computed from CME settlements.

CIP formula (verified to ±0.00bp against the official CME tool; this
pipeline uses the exact third-Monday IMM date plus EOD spot, so daily
reproduction can deviate a few bp from the tool — the brief number is an
estimate, not a claim of identity):
  F_cip = S · (1 + r_US·τ) / (1 + r_EU·τ)
  basis_bps = ((F_actual − F_cip) / F_cip) / τ · 10^4
  τ = ACT/360 per IMM period; rates from the SR3 + ESR strips; F from 6E futures.

All inputs come from cme_settlements + instrument_prices.
