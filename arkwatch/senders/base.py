"""base.py — the Channel contract.

The outbox is channel-agnostic (the `channel` column); a gateway is a
per-channel adapter implementing this contract. Telegram is the first
adapter; a Discord webhook follows (active only when DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL is
set). Thin purpose-built adapters (Apprise's idea, without its dependency
weight): fine-grained per-channel control of parse-mode/split/rate-limit
matters more than support for 100+ services.

    - a failed send returns None or raises; the outbox handles retry/status
