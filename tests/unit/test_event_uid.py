"""Regression tests for the canonical event_uid (D-027 P0 fix, ronde-5 P1).

The defect class: two writers constructing DIFFERENT uids for the same event
created a parallel row population the calendar upsert could never reach —
actuals starved silently for 92.5% of rows. These tests pin the invariant.
