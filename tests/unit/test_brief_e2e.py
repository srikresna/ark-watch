"""E2E brief-render guard on a seeded fixture (round-9 meta-gap fix).

Round-7 shipped three days of brief-render bugs with a green suite. The
only full-render tests were (a) test_golden_brief.py — structure-only,
on a COPY of the live DB, skipping in CI — and (b) the flows-section
fixtures in test_flows_extra.py. NOTHING asserted that content lines
stay coherent with their drivers: the R7 P0 smile-prefix bug (suffix
"(as of MM-DD)" breaking `== "WEAK"` → XAUUSD driver line dead +
EURUSD contradicting the Dollar header) would have passed every
existing test.

This module renders the FULL brief on a minimal seeded DB and asserts
content, not just section presence. Missing data must not raise (the
brief degrades gracefully) — the fixture is deliberately tiny.

The render clock is pinned to a WIB WEEKDAY: the Saturday variant cuts
Book implications (the smile-driven lines under test), so an unpinned
run would make the assertions depend on the day the suite executes.
