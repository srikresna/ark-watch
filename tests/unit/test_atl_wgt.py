"""Offline test for the ATL:WGT parse fix (health-sweep 2026-09-21).

The original wiring looked for a 'data_overview' sheet that does not exist
(it is data_overall) and a 'date' text header that is not there either —
the fallback chain landed on data_chart1 and a zero-valued column, storing
0.0 as the wage-growth median and sailing through sanity_min=0.0. This test
recreates the REAL sheet shape (source row, 'Overall' header, TEXT values)
and pins the corrected behavior.
