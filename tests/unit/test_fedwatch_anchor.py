"""ROUND-8 regression tests: the FedWatch decided-anchor snap and the
DIY-vs-official gate breach observability.

Live incident reconstructed (all numbers from production 2026-09-18):
  FOMC hiked on 2026-09-16 (upper 4.00 → midpoint 3.875). DFF@09-16 still
  prints the OLD 3.63 (new target effective T+1) and FRED had not published
  DFF@09-17 even by 09-18 17:45 UTC. With the old strict `>` the snap only
  fired for a few hours on decision evening; from D+1 the anchor reverted to
  3.63 and the replay-bootstrap (market-expected 3.865) drove the brief
  ("hike 62%" vs official 57.6%). The >= predicate keeps the DECIDED rate
  anchored through the whole publication-lag window.
