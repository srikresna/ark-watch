"""daemon day-state persistence — ROUND-11 regression tests.

Live defect (2026-09-19 05:26 UTC): a deploy-restart landed 64 seconds
into verify's 10-minute retry. The retry schedule is in-memory and died
with the process, while the persisted already-ran key (written
unconditionally, failure or not) cancelled the day's only automatic
recovery. Contract under test: only SUCCEEDED jobs persist/restore — a
failed job re-runs exactly once per restart."""
